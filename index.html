        <h2> About the Artist </h2>
        <p> Hi! My name is Lucy Holmes and I am an artist from West Virginia. I made this web page as a virtual art profile. I enjoy using markers, colored pencils, and just pencils and paper with my art. I have been drawing and creating art for almost my enire life, and began to take my art seriously around 6 years ago. I hope you enjoy! </p>
